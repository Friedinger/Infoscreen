# Infoscreen

Infoscreen for [Azubiwerk MÃ¼nchen](https://azubiwerk-muenchen.de/) that displays departures of public transport and changing, custom news.

Departure times are fetched from API of local transport operator [MVG](https://www.mvg.de/) for specific station and displayed on webpage.

Custom news are displayed alternating, switching is automatic with custom interval.

Settings can be changed in admin portal:
- Uploading of new news
- Deleting news

Interval for reloading page is required to get new settings if infoscreen is displayed on kiosk screen like [FullPageOS](https://github.com/guysoft/FullPageOS).
